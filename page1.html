        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h2>Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          Medusa's most distinctive attribute is her hair made of snakes. She
          possesses a gaze that turns any living being into stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her origins are traced to Gorgon, one of the three sisters with snakes
          for hair and the ability to petrify those who looked at them.

        <h2>Stories and Legends</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most famous stories involving Medusa is the tale of
          Perseus, who was tasked with defeating her. With the help of the gods,
          Perseus managed to slay Medusa by avoiding direct eye contact and
          using a reflective shield to see her indirectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Medusa's head was later used as a weapon by Perseus, and it retained
          its petrifying power even after her death.
